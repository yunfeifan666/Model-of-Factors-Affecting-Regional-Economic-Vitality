Regional economic vitality is as a pivotal indicator, reflecting both the economic robustness and competitive edge of a city. Its significance extends beyond the city level, playing a crucial role in the broader spectrum of national economic development. Drawing from economic theory, I identified a set of factors that influence a city's economic vitality. Employing principal component analysis, a mathematical model, I explored the interrelationships among 13 key factors and their impact on regional economic vitality.

Through this analysis, I isolated 5 principal components along with their respective weights, showcasing the efficacy and influence of these factors through robust representations. This led to a comprehensive formula, which I applied to rank the economic vitality of 19 cities. Additionally, I employed the control variable method to investigate the impact of economic transformation on Shenzhen's economic vitality, examining both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. Comparisons between the economic data of Shenzhen and China were made to underscore their lasting influence.

After that, I proposed actionable recommendations aimed at enhancing economic vitality. These recommendations spanned various facets, including the quantity of sustainable enterprises, environmental sustainability, resident population dynamics, and investments in science, technology, and education.

Moreover, I conducted an in-depth analysis considering the evolving trends in population dynamics and enterprise vitality, showcasing principle of a wooden barrel. This methodology was instrumental in measuring the sensitivity of the model measuring factors affecting economic vitality.
